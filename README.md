# Diabetes_Dataset

## Objective
The purpose of this repo is to play around with the diabetes dataset.

### Methods Used
* Decision Trees
* Cross Validation
* Confusion Matrix
* Data Visualization

### Repo info
* decisiontree.ipynb is the notebook used to train and visualize the dataset
* preprocessing.py contains functions to load csv, seperate labels and plot a confusion matrix 
* .csv files are respectively the training set and the prediction set(originally for class submission)

### Work in Progress
* Create more features
* Play around with more powerful libraries
* Hopefully, these lead to higher accuracy score
